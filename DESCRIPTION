Description: Mitochondrial (MT) mutations serve as natural genetic markers for inferring clonal relationships using single-cell sequencing data. However, the fundamental challenge of MT mutation-based lineage tracing is automated identification of informative MT mutations. Here, we introduced an open-source computational algorithm called “MitoTracer”, which accurately identified clonally informative MT mutations and inferred evolutionary lineage from scRNA-seq or scATAC-seq samples. We benchmarked MitoTracer using the ground-truth experimental lineage sequencing data and demonstrated its superior performance over the existing methods measured by high sensitivity and specificity. MitoTracer is compatible with multiple single cell sequencing platforms.
