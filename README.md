# MitoTracer
MitoTracer facilitates the identification of informative mitochondrial mutations for precise lineage reconstruction
>This is a README file of the R package MitoTracer. In our Paper, MitoTracer facilitates the identification of informative mitochondrial mutations for precise lineage reconstruction, we develop an open-source computational algorithm called “MitoTracer”, which accurately identified clonally informative MT mutations and inferred evolutionary lineage from scRNA-seq or scATAC-seq samples. We benchmarked MitoTracer using the ground-truth experimental lineage sequencing data and demonstrated its superior performance over the existing methods measured by high sensitivity and specificity. MitoTracer is compatible with multiple single cell sequencing platforms.
